**This is meant to be used with text files that have the following format:**

*1 door*

*2 car*

*3 tomatoes*

*...*


**The words can be anything and the numbers can be in any order:**

*193 land*

*284 sun*

*16 too*

*136 huge*

*...*


# How it Works:

~ The text file should be named "coding_qual_input.txt" (you can change it in the code if you want.)

~ The words are decoded based on a sorted pyramid schematic

~ The last word in each row is printed

Ex.                 

                    1

                  2   3
                  
                4   5   6
                
**Whatever words are prefixed with 1, 3, and 6 will be printed.**

*1 design*

*2 of*

*3 all*

*4 power*

*5 excite*

*6 skill*

**Prints: design all skill**
