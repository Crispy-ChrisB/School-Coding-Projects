# School-Coding-Projects
All of my coding projects from my 2021 and 2022 classes
They were all coded in Apache Netbeans
Separated into 2021 Projects and 2022 Projects for 2 major reasons
1. To show growth of knowledge and experience over time
2. Some files were the same name and needed to be distinguished from one another
